# Visualizations created using various different tools
## Vega-Lite
[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation. <br />

I've used Vega-Lite inside PowerBI to create custom visuals as needed. <br /> 

### ARR Snowball <br />
A useful tool to see how well (or poorly) you're retaining and growing your customer base.

## Python
[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. <br />
### Actual vs Budget Comparison <br />
This visual quickly displays attainment to targets, clearly highlighting over and underperformers, along with their magnitude. <br />
